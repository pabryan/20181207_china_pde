* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

We study long-time existence and asymptotic behavior for a class of anisotropic, expanding curvature flows. For this we adapt new curvature estimates, which were developed by Guan, Ren and Wang to treat some stationary prescribed curvature problems. As an application we give a unified flow approach to the existence of smooth, even $L_p$-Minkowski problems in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for $p > âˆ’(n+1)$. Such problems generalise the Minkowski problem of prescribing Gauss curvature arising similarly via $L_p$-mixed volumes generalising the mixed volumes in the Brunn-Minkowksi theory.

** On The Importance of Being Minkowski

#+BEGIN_quote
The importance of the Minkowski problem and its solution is to be felt both in differential geometry and elliptic partial differential equations, on either count going far beyond the impact that the literal statement superficially may have. From the geometric view point it is the Rosetta Stone, from which several related problems can be solved.

* The \(L_p\)-Minkowski Problem
** Support Function and Gauss map

Let \(\Omega \subseteq \RR^{n+1}\) be a /strictly/ convex body containing the origin, with smooth boundary \(\partial \Omega = F(M)\) and let \(\nu(x)\) be the unit normal at \(x \in M\). \pause

- Then \(\nu : M \to \sphere^n\) is a diffeomorphism. \pause

Define the /support function/ \(h\) to be the distance to the supporting hyperplane with normal \(z\):
\[
h(x) = \ip{F(x)}{\nu(x)} (x \in M), \quad h(z) = \ip{F(\nu^{-1}(z))}{z}, (z \in \sphere^n).
\]

\pause

To recover \(\Omega\) from \(h\):
\[
F(\nu^{-1}(z)) = h(z) z + \nabla_{\sphere^{n}} h.
\]
\pause

The \(\Omega\)-surface measure on \(\sphere^n\). For \(V \subseteq \sphere^n\):
\[
\sigma_{\Omega} (V) := \nu_{\sharp} \sigma_M (V) := \sigma_M (\nu^{-1} (V)) = \frac{1}{K \circ \nu^{-1}} \sigma_{\sphere^n} (V).
\]

** The Minkowski Problem

Prescribed Gauss curvature problem:

- Let \(\varphi : \sphere^n \to \RR\) be a smooth, positive function. \pause
- Does there exist a smooth convex body \(\Omega \subseteq \RR^{n+1}\) with boundary \(M = \partial \Omega\) such that
  \[
  \nu_{\sharp} \sigma_M = \sigma := \varphi \sigma_{\sphere^n}?
  \]
  Here \(\nu : M \to \sphere^n\) is the Gauss map which is a diffeomorphism. \pause

Prescribed Gauss curvature \(K\) since if \(K(x) = 1/\varphi(\nu(x))\), then
\[
\nu_{\sharp} \sigma_M = \frac{1}{K \circ \nu^{-1}} \sigma_{\sphere^n} = \varphi \sigma_{\sphere^n}.
\]
\pause

- Answer is yes provided \(\sigma\) has centroid at the origin. Note this is necessary since \(\int \frac{1}{K (\nu^{-1} (z))} z d\sigma_{\sphere^n} = 0\).

** Minkowksi Sums, Mixed Volumes And Integral Formula

- Let \(\Omega_1, \Omega_2\) be convex bodies with support functions \(h_1, h_2\). \pause
- For \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \geq 0\)
  - Define \(\lambda_1 \Omega_1 + \lambda_2 \Omega_2\) to be the convex body with support function \(\lambda_1 h_1 + \lambda_2 h_2\). \pause

Mixed Volume:
\[
V_1(\Omega_1, \Omega_2) = \frac{1}{n+1} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \frac{V(\Omega_1 + \epsilon \Omega_2) - V(\Omega_1)}{\epsilon}.
\]
\pause

Integral Representation
\[
V_1(\Omega_1, \Omega_2) = \frac{1}{n+1} \int_{\sphere^n} h_2 (z) d\sigma_1(z)
\]
where \(\sigma_1 = \nu_{\sharp} \sigma_1 = \frac{1}{K_1} \sigma_{\sphere^n}\). \pause

- Prescribed curvature: \(\Omega_2 = \mathbb{B}^{n+1} \Rightarrow h_2 \equiv 1\). Given \(\sigma = \varphi \sigma_{\sphere^n}\), solve for \(K = \varphi^{-1}\)!

** Firey Sums, Mixed \(p\)-volumes And Integral Formula

- Let \(\Omega_1, \Omega_2\) be convex bodies with support functions \(h_1, h_2\). \pause
- For \(p \geq 1\) and \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \geq 0\)
  - Define \(\lambda_1 \Omega_1 +_p \lambda_2 \Omega_2\) to be the convex body with support function \(\lambda_1 h_1^p + \lambda_2 h_2^p\). \pause

Mixed \(p\)-Volume:
\[
V_p(\Omega_1, \Omega_2) = \frac{1}{n+1} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \frac{V(\Omega_1 +_p \epsilon \Omega_2) - V(\Omega_1)}{\epsilon}.
\]
\pause

Integral Representation
\[
V_p(\Omega_1, \Omega_2) = \frac{p}{n+1} \int_{\sphere^n} h_2^p (z) d\sigma_1^p(z) = \frac{p}{n+1} \int_{\sphere^n} h_2^p (z) h_1^{1-p} d\sigma_1(z).
\]

** The \(L_p\)-Minkowski Problem

Integral Representation
\[
V_p(\Omega, \sphere^n) = \frac{p}{n+1} \int_{\sphere^n} h^{1-p} dS(z) = \frac{p}{n+1} \int_{\sphere^n} \frac{h^{1-p}}{K} d\sigma_{\sphere^n}.
\]
\pause

*** 

Given a measure \(\sigma = \varphi \sigma_{\sphere^n}\), when is it equal to \(\sigma_{\Omega}^p\) for some convex body \(\Omega\)?\pause Precisely when we may solve the \(L_p\) prescribed curvature equation:
\[
\frac{h^{1-p}}{K} = \varphi
\]

* The Flow
** Definition Of The Flow

#+Begin_export latex
\[
\begin{cases}
\partial_t F &= \varphi(\nu) \frac{h^{2-p}}{K} \nu \\
F(\cdot,0) &= F_{0}(\cdot).
\end{cases}
\]

\pause

- Speed \(V = \varphi h^{2-p} K^{-1}\) is /anisotropic/ with dependence not only on \(\nu\) but also \(h\). \pause
- Expect convergence to self-similar solutions (after volume normalisation) satisfying:
  \[
  h = \ip{F}{\nu} = \text{const} V = \text{const} \> h^{2-p} \varphi K^{-1}.
  \]
  \pause

*** 
Self-similar solutions solve the \(L_p\)-Minkowski problem:
\[
\frac{h^{1-p} (\nu(x))}{k(x)} = \frac{\lambda}{\varphi(\nu(x))}
\]

** Evolution Of The Support Function

\[
\partial_t h = \varphi h^{2-p} \det \left(\bar{\nabla}^2 h + h \id\right)
\]

\pause

Self similar solutions
\[
h^{1-p} \det \left(\bar{\nabla}^2 h + h \id\right) = \frac{c}{\varphi}
\]

** Convergence Results Of The Flow: The Even Case

Let $-(n+1)<p<\infty$ and $\varphi$ be a positive, smooth even function on $\mathbb{S}^{n}$ i.e., $\varphi(u)=\varphi(-u)$. Suppose the initial body $\Omega_0$ is origin-symmetric.

\pause

#+begin_theorem
There exists a unique origin-symmetric solution $\{M_t\}$ of the flow such that $\{\tilde{M}_t\}$ converges for a subsequence of times in $C^{1}$ to a smooth, origin-symmetric, strictly convex self similar solution. Also, when $p\leq n+1$ the convergence is in $C^{\infty}$, and if $p\ge 1$ the convergence holds for the full sequence.
#+end_theorem

** Convergence Results Of The Flow: \(-(n+1) < p < -n\)

Let $-(n+1) < p\leq -n$, and /do not assume/ $\varphi$ is even. Let the initial body $\Omega_0$ have \santalo{} point at the origin, i.e.
$$\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n}}\frac{u}{h_{\omega_0}(u)^{1-p}} \frac{1}{\varphi(u)} d\sigma(u)=0.$$
\pause

#+BEGIN_theorem
There exists a unique solution $\{M_t\}$ of flow such that $\{\tilde{M}_t\}$ converges for a subsequence of times in $C^{\infty}$ to a positive, smooth, strictly convex self similar solution.
#+END_theorem

** Convergence Results Of The Flow: The (almost) Isotropic Case

Let $\varphi\equiv 1$, $1\neq p>-(n+1)$ and $\Omega_0$ have \santalo{} point at the origin.

\pause

#+BEGIN_theorem
There exists a unique solution $\{M_t\}$ of the flow such that $\{\tilde{M}_t\}$ converges  in $C^{1}$ to the unit sphere. In addition, for $1\neq p\leq n+1$ the convergence holds in $C^{\infty}$.
